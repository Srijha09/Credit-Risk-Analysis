## Credit Risk Analysis
This project is focused on analyzing credit risk to predict the likelihood of loan defaults. By leveraging historical loan data, machine learning models are trained to identify patterns that signify high-risk credit applicants. The results can help financial institutions make informed lending decisions and minimize potential losses.

## Project Overview
Credit risk analysis is essential for financial institutions to evaluate the risk associated with lending to a specific applicant. The projectâ€™s primary goal is to build a predictive model to classify applicants into different risk levels, helping lenders in decision-making processes.

#### Key Objectives:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying patterns and insights from the dataset.

Model Development: Training and testing machine learning models for accurate prediction.

Model Evaluation: Comparing model performances using various evaluation metrics.

Interpretability: Understanding which factors contribute most to credit risk.

#### Data
The dataset used in this project consists of historical credit data, containing features such as:

- Applicant demographics (age, income, employment status, etc.)
  
- Loan information (amount, term, purpose, etc.)
  
- Credit history (credit score, delinquencies, etc.)
  
- Loan status (default or non-default)
